    "# 4.2 Twenty-Two\n",
    "\n",
    "This section lists the most common techniques for shortening and tightening your Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Python line continuation as needed\n",
    "- Use for loops intelligently\n",
    "- Understand combined operator assignment\n",
    "- Use multiple assignment\n",
    "- Use tuple assignment\n",
    "- Use advanced tuple assignment\n",
    "- Use list and string \"multiplication\"\n",
    "- Return multiple values\n",
    "- Use loops and the **else** keyword\n",
    "- Take advantage of booleans and **not**\n",
    "- Treat strings as list of characters\n",
    "- Eliminate characters by using **replace**\n",
    "- Don't write unnecessary loops\n",
    "- Use chained comparisons\n",
    "- Simulate \"Switch\" with a table of functions\n",
    "- Use the **is** operator correctly\n",
    "- Use the one-line for loops\n",
    "- Squeeze multiple statements onto a line\n",
    "- Write one-line if/then/else statements\n",
    "- Create Enum values with range\n",
    "- Reduce the inefficiency of the print function\n",
    "- Place underscores inside large numbers"

    "But what if you need to write a statement longer than one physical line? You might have. astirng ro print that you can't fit on one line. You could use literal quotations, but line wraps in that case, are translated as newlines-something you might not want. \n",

    "The solution, first of all, is to recognize that literal strings positioned next to other literal strings are automatically concatenated."

Consequently, you can enter as long a statement as you want and you can enter a string of any length you wnt without necessarily inserting newlines."
